# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Shumate

I'm a data scientist with 10+ years of experience working in pharmaceutical R&D, where I've supported drug discovery and clinical development with data-driven insights.
I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable stories using R, the tidyverse, and Quarto.

## 💊 Professional Background

In the pharmaceutical space, I’ve led projects involving:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling for clinical and preclinical research
- Visual storytelling for regulatory submissions and cross-functional presentations
- Custom R functions and reproducible pipelines

I bring a rigorous, scientific approach to every dataset—and a strong belief in making results both transparent and impactful.

## ⚽ A Passion for Soccer + Data

Outside of pharma, I’m a lifelong soccer player, fan, and student of the game. I love using data to dig into:

- Player and team performance trends  
- Match results and tournament analysis  
- Tactical insights
- Fan engagement and storytelling

## 📊 What I Love Working On

- 📈 Creating beautiful, functional data visualizations  
- ✍️ Writing reproducible reports and case studies in Quarto  
- 🎯 Finding the balance between precision and simplicity in analysis

## 🔍 Featured Projects

- 🧪 **[clinical-insightR](#)** – R workflow for clinical research EDA
- ⚽ **[local-tournament-analysis](#)** – A deep dive into a local team’s performance
- 📦 **[typoFixR](#)** – Customizable typo and naming format corrections for merging messy datasets

## 🚀 Let’s Connect

I'm always looking to collaborate on soccer analytics, sports storytelling, or open-source R projects. If you're into data, the beautiful game, or both—let’s chat!
